A Turing tasks Test tasks is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. The test is named after Alan Turing, the founder of the Turing Test and an English computer scientist, cryptanalyst, mathematician and theoretical biologist.
The phrase “The Turing Test” is most properly used to refer to a proposal made by Turing in (1950) as a way of dealing with the question whether machines can think. This then laid down the foundation stone in the domain Artificial Intelligence.
Though the Turing Test and its concepts weren’t appraised for its capabilities then, it has just gained momentum in the 21st century, after the data revolution and advance development in hardware capabilities. 
These machines once developed will be capable of solving and developing solutions of their own, thus increasing the overall development in the fields of science and technology.
As of the year 2020 there hasn’t been a single machine developed that has successfully passed the Turing Test.
The perseverance is still on.
Alan Turing a brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking Nazi ciphers during WWII. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. His work is widely acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence.
During World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime code-breaking, particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley Park, the GCCS wartime station, where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including specifying the bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher German Enigma encrypted signals.
Turing’s contributions to the code-breaking process didn’t stop there: He also wrote two papers about mathematical approaches to code-breaking, which became such important assets to the Code and Cypher School.
Turing went on to hold high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and later the computing laboratory at the University of Manchester in the late 1940s. He first addressed the issue of artificial intelligence in his 1950 paper, "Computing machinery and intelligence," and proposed an experiment known as the “Turing Test” — an effort to create an intelligence design standard for the tech industry. Over the past several decades, the test has significantly influenced debates over artificial intelligence.

Before Alan Turing could develop this unique theory of machines and how they can be used, machines where merely considered as lower-class citizens that would do the general, repeated task that was told upon them to be completed.
Machines weren’t given the opportunity or the chance to perform more comprehensive or more logical task. During Alan Turing’s time cryptography had been a booming sector due to the world war as every nation tried to maintain secrecy in their position and also communicate with their associates on the other side. Owing to this decoding these encrypted codes where merely a game of mathematics.
And thus, machines where roped into performing loads and loads of mathematical operations to decode the message.
Alan Turing on the other hand had a different vision, he saw machines not just tools, to perform the tasks or order given upon them, but as powerful objects capable of replicating the human mind and developing their own solutions with their own thinking.
This view of his, revolutionized the way people looked at computers,
His unique ideology changed the course of history when he developed the enigma breaker and reduced the course of the war by nearly 4 years.

A Turing machine is a hypothetical machine invented by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. Despite its simplicity, the machine can simulate ANY computer algorithm, no matter how complicated it is!
Above is a very simple representation of a Turing machine. It consists of an infinitely-long tape which acts like the memory in a typical computer, or any other form of data storage. The squares on the tape are usually blank at the start and can be written with symbols. In this case, the machine can only process the symbols 0 and 1 and " " (blank), and is thus said to be a 3-symbol Turing machine.
At any one time, the machine has a head which is positioned over one of the squares on the tape. With this head, the machine can perform three very basic operations:
Read the symbol on the square under the head.
Edit the symbol by writing a new symbol or erasing it.
Move the tape left of right by one square so that the machine can read and edit the symbol on a neighbouring square.

In short, the answer is no, they aren’t the same. Turing test isn’t the test that is performed on Turing machines. 
Turing machines had been completely developed at that time and also were deployed and deemed successful and effective.
It was a physical machine that could be seen and used and which ran on the algorithms developed and designed by Turing.
Turing test on the other hand was merely a concept, an idea or a spark with Alan Turing’s brain. An abstract concept with no physical view. Turing was limited by the technology of his time and also development rate in hardware was slow. The prices of components weren’t cheap as well.
The reason for them having the same name is because they were developed by the same scientist Alan Turing. 
However, the knowledge and the experimentation put behind the Turing machines helped Alan Turing device this test. Also, after successfully developing and implementing the Turing machines Alan Turing earned a lot of praises, financial support, political support as well as resources, which enables him to carry out his experiments.
Thus, enabling him in the year 1950, to publish the first ever paper on Turing test, this laid the foundation for machine learning, deep learning, neural networks as well as artificial intelligence.
Alan Turing predicted that by the year 2000, the Turing test would have been passed but as of now 2020, there hasn’t been a single machine which has passed the test by a 100% 
Thus, Alan Turing has been regarded as the father of Artificial intelligence and modern computing.

A Turing Test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence (AI) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being. The test is named after Alan Turing, the founder of the Turning Test and an English computer scientist, cryptanalyst, mathematician and theoretical biologist.
Turing proposed that a computer can be said to possess artificial intelligence if it can mimic human responses under specific conditions. The original Turing Test requires three terminals, each of which is physically separated from the other two. One terminal is operated by a computer, while the other two are operated by humans.

In this test, one of the human’s functions as the questioner, while the other human and the computer function as respondents. The questioner interrogates the respondents within a specific subject area, using a specified format and context. After a duration of time or number of questions, the questioner is then asked to decide which respondent was human and which was a computer.
The test is repeated many times. If the questioner makes the correct determination in half of the test runs or less, the computer is considered to have artificial intelligence because the questioner regards it as "just as human" as the human respondent.
So basically, in this the computer has to try and imitate a human, for example if he has to imitate a 15 year old boy, it should not be to intelligent, it should try to be a little amateur in its wordings.
Why we need machines to be more like us, the major reason being automation. We humans have one goal to always make this easier and better for us for this purpose, we invent stuff that reduce ours laborious tasks. The reason why home automation and machines in factories are increasing exponentially. We want our machines to understand us and to communicate with us so that we can ease the task of performing automation.

In his paper published in 1950, Turing proposed a twist on what is called “The Imitation Game.” The Imitation Game involves no use of AI, but rather three human participants in three separate rooms. Each room is connected via a screen and keyboard, one containing a male, the other a female, and the other containing a male or female judge. The female tries to convince the judge that she is the male, and the judge tries to disseminate which is which.
Turing changes the concept of this game to include an AI, a human and a human questioner. The questioner’s job is then to decide which is the AI and which is the human. Science the formation of the test, many AI have been able to pass; one of the first is a program created by Joseph Weizenbaum called ELIZA.

But it was in the 1950 paper that Turing held, most fully and confidently, that computers would, in time, be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence. Even where he saw difficulties and was doubtful about what could be achieved, he advocated experiment. He saw this not a dogma, but as an important conjecture, to guide future research.
The paper has many aspects to it, including
An exposition of the discrete state machine model, which gets away from all earlier discussion of homunculi, life forces, etc. etc. and places the discussion within a clear logical framework.
A rather corner-cutting account of computability and the universal machine as Turing had discovered in 1936.
Answers to many specific objections to the prospect of 'intelligent machinery', broadly reflecting discussions such as that held in 1949.
Constructive suggestions for how Artificial Intelligence might be arrived at, including what are in modern terms both top-down and bottom-up approaches.
But the most famous element of his paper lies in his Test. Turing put forward the idea of an 'imitation game', in which a human being and a computer would be interrogated under conditions where the interrogator would not know which was which, the communication being entirely by textual messages. Turing argued that if the interrogator could not distinguish them by questioning, then it would be unreasonable not to call the computer intelligent, because we judge other people's intelligence from external observation in just this way.

The Test allows Turing to avoid any discussion of what consciousness is. It seems to provide a scientific, objective, criterion of what is being discussed but with the rather odd necessity of 'imitation' and deceit coming into it, for the machine is obliged to assert a falsity, whilst the human being is not.
Turing's 'imitation game' is now usually called 'the Turing test' for intelligence.

There were many philosophers who completely disagreed with the complete concept of Artificial Intelligence. The most famous argument in this list was "Chinese Room."
In the year 1980, John Searle presented the "Chinese Room"  experiment, in his paper "Mind, Brains, and Program," which was against the validity of Turing's Test. According to his argument, "Programming a computer may make it to understand a language, but it will not produce a real understanding of language or consciousness in a computer."
He argued that Machine such as ELIZA and Parry could easily pass the Turing test by manipulating keywords and symbol, but they had no real understanding of a language. So, it cannot be describe the "thinking" capability of a machine, such as a human.
Features required for a machine to pass the Turing test:
Natural language processing: NLP is required to communicate with Interrogator in general human language like English.
Knowledge representation: To store and retrieve information during the test.
Automated reasoning: To use the previously stored information for answering the questions.
Machine learning: To adapt new changes and can detect generalized patterns.
Vision (For total Turing test): To recognize the interrogator actions and other objects during a test.
Motor Control (For total Turing test): To act upon objects if requested.

A computer program called Eugene Goostman, which simulates a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, is said to have passed the Turing test at an event organised by the University of Reading in 2014.
The test investigated whether people could detect if they were talking to machines or humans.
The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think?
No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it was reported.
However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour.

The Condition
The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations.
On 7 June Eugene convinced 33% of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human.
Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal.
Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013.

Requirements to pass the Turing test
To pass the Turing test a machine has to behave like a human, so how does a human behave? And what makes us unique?
A human doesn’t developed knowledge in one go, it happens over a period of time. From the time we are born we are always learning through experience sometimes through supervised learning from our parents and school. And unsupervised ways where we try to apply our own logic by segregating. And reinforcement that is through mistakes.
Machines on the other hand don’t learn like us they are fed with instructions and data in a single input, and thus there is no learning taking place.

Machines on the other hand don’t learn like us they are fed with instructions and data in a single input, and thus there is no learning taking place.
So, in order to stimulate learning in machines we require a large memory and storage to store all the past experience and thus learn from them and draw a conclusion. Another important feature is NLP natural language processing, as computers can’t understand our language, they communicate in binary forms that is in zero’s and one’s. So thus, NLP acts as a translator to translate our dialect into binary code for the machines to understand.
Also, efficient, dynamic algorithms are needed to be developed to make meaning out of the data and take dynamic real-time decisions. A capability of a human is defined by his thinking and reasoning. Advance algorithms have been developed that perform this in the given time frame. We need emotions as well, to give it the human touch of being a human. For these reasons’ emotions were needed to be filled so that it resembles more like a human.
The last factor would be training time, the more the training time greater the results would be. The best example is Sophia a humanoid by Hanson Robotics Hong Kong, wherein they completed her development in 2016 and ever since exposed her to the outside world in domains like politics, economic, sports, and other industries.  Thus, maker her more human-like with every passing year.
